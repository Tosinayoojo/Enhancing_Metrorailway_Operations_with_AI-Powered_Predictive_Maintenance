Developed an AI-powered predictive maintenance system to detect early signs of equipment failure in Air Production Units (APUs) of metro railway stations, reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.

🔹 Problem:
Traditional maintenance approaches (reactive & preventive) lead to unplanned failures, excessive costs, and inefficiencies.

🔹 Solution:
Designed and implemented a Machine Learning & Deep Learning system using real-time sensor data to forecast failures before they occur, ensuring proactive intervention.

🔹 Tools & Techniques Used:
✅ Data Processing & Visualization: Python (Pandas, NumPy), R, Power BI, Tableau
✅ Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
✅ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (achieved 98.83% accuracy)
✅ Deployment: Integrated into a real-time monitoring system for predictive insights

🔹 Impact & Results:
🚀 98.83% failure prediction accuracy → Enabled proactive maintenance
💰 Reduced maintenance costs → Minimized unnecessary repairs
⏳ Improved operational efficiency → Reduced metro downtime
🏆 Enhanced passenger safety & reliability → More efficient service

🔹 Key Takeaway:
Predictive maintenance is transforming industrial operations by reducing failures, optimizing resources, and increasing reliability.
